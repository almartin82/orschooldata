\description{
Oregon ODE Fall Membership Reports use year-prefixed column names.
For example, 2023-24 data uses columns like:
\itemize{
\item 20232024_total_enrollment (for the current year total)
\item 202324_kindergarten, 202324_grade_one, etc. (for grade breakdowns)
}
}
\details{
The column naming conventions vary slightly between years:
\itemize{
\item District ID: district_institution_id, attending_district_institution_id
\item School ID: school_institution_id, attending_school_institution_id, attending_school_id
\item District name: district_name, district
\item School name: school_name, school
}
}
