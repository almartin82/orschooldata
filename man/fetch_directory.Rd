\title{Fetch Oregon school directory data}
\usage{
fetch_directory(end_year = NULL, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{Currently unused. The directory data represents current
institutions and is not year-specific. Included for API consistency with
other fetch functions.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in a standardized format with
consistent column names. If FALSE, returns raw column names from ODE.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from ODE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with school directory data. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{state_school_id}: Oregon institution ID
\item \code{state_district_id}: Parent district institution ID (for schools)
\item \code{school_name}: Institution name
\item \code{district_name}: Parent district name (for schools)
\item \code{school_type}: Type of institution (School, District, Program)
\item \code{city}: City location
\item \code{state}: State (always "OR")
\item \code{agg_level}: Aggregation level ("S" = School, "D" = District, "P" = Program)
}
}
\description{
Downloads and processes school directory data from the Oregon Department
of Education Report Card system. This includes public schools, districts,
and programs with their names, types, and locations.
}
\details{
The directory data is retrieved via the ODE Report Card API, which provides
a JSON list of all institutions receiving report cards. This data is updated
periodically by ODE.

Note: This API does not include full addresses, phone numbers, or
administrator names. For complete contact information, download the

\dontrun{
# Get school directory data
dir_data <- fetch_directory()

# Get raw format (original ODE column names)
dir_raw <- fetch_directory(tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
dir_fresh <- fetch_directory(use_cache = FALSE)

# Filter to schools only
library(dplyr)
schools_only <- dir_data |>
  filter(agg_level == "S")

# Find all schools in a district
portland_schools <- dir_data |>
  filter(district_name == "Portland SD 1J", agg_level == "S")
